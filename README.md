Mellivora
=========

Mellivora is a basic database driven CTF engine written in PHP.

### Requirements

- LAMP: PHP 5.3.7+, MySQL 5.5+, Apache 2.2+. Will likely work with other configurations but this is untested.

### Installation

- Download to any directory, say: "/var/www/mellivora/".
- Create an Apache VHost and point DocumentRoot to "htdocs/". An example Apache config can be found in the "install/" directory.
- Create a database and import the structure from "install/db.sql".
- Edit "config.inc.php" and "db.inc.php" in the "config/" directory.
- Make the "writable/" directory and its subdirectories writable by Apache.
- Create a user by signing up to the site. Make the user an administrator by manually changing its "class" value to "CONFIG_UC_MODERATOR" (default: 100) in the "users" table in the database.

### Troubleshooting

- Apache gives a 404 when visiting pages without the .php extension.
 - The easiest way to fix this is to use Apache's "MultiViews". You'll also need to add "AddType application/x-httpd-php .php" to your Apache configuration. See example config in "install/". Alternatively, use mod_rewrite.

### Performance
Mellivora is lightweight. And fast. Very fast. Want to run a large competition on an EC2 micro instance? No problem!? Benchmarks are hard and often unhelpful. Here are some of those. Benchmarks performed locally on Mellivora's heaviest page (scores.php), with 85 registered teams and 45 challenges. The WordPress instance used for comparison is a fresh out-of-box install, and the page loaded is the default post-install welcome screen. Tools: Xdebug 2.2.3, SIEGE 3.0.5 and ApacheBench 2.3.
