Installing Mellivora
=========

People run Mellivora on various configurations. Feel free to follow one of our setup guides below:

 - [LAMP](lamp/README.md) (Ubuntu, Apache, MySQL, PHP). This is the officially supported configuration. Also contains [ngix example config](lamp/mellivora.nginx.conf).
 - [Caddy](caddy/README.md) (Ubuntu, Caddy, MariaDB, PHP).
 - [Docker](docker/README.md) For a quick and easy setup using docker-compose.

If you have set up Mellivora on a different environment, consider adding a guide to help others!
